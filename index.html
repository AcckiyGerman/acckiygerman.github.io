			<p>Good Day.</p>
			<p>In school I made small games on BASIC and I liked the feeling of creating programs so much. In
				March 2015 I decided to seriously study programming. My strong skills and work experience as IT
				System Administrator proofed to be a strong base. I chose Python as my main direction and then
				turned to web-programming. The resources I use for my studies are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PYTHON: Mark Luchs 'Learning Python', 'Programming Python', <a href='www.checkio.org'>www.checkio.	org</a> (solving code tasks online)
				<li>HTML: online course on <a href='www.htmlacademy.ru'>www.htmlacademy.ru</a>
				<li>CSS: online courses <a href='www.htmlacademy.ru'>www.htmlacademy.ru</a> and <a href='www.htmlbook.ru'>www.htmlbook.ru</a>
				<li>JAVASCRIPT: Marijn Haverbeke 'Eloquent JavaScript'.
				<li>Git & GitHub
				<li>RegExp (suddenly, the best tutorial is in the wikipedia)
			</ul>
			<p>Also I have experience in LINUX server administration (Apache, MAIL, DNS, FTP-services,
				web-sites deploying), which can be useful in web-programming to understand the reasons of some
				problems.</p>
			<p>My next step will be to get practical experience in a software company and to learn DJANGO
				framework. Also, I am interested in programming small browser games with JavaScript.</p>
			<p>I would like to work with company which will offer support for beginners because there is still a
				lot for me to learn, so I need some assistance in real work.</p>
			<p>Now to the benefit I can bring your company: I am an enthusiastic, responsible and fast-learning
				person and could be a valuable member of your great team. I have experience in working with de-
				manding clients, understand the value of proper documentation of my work, can teach other people
				things I know well and also have experience of organizing work and managing people in small
				projects. I am ready to start from a lower level in a career as Software Engineer and am sure we can successfully work together.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Yours faithfully, Dmytro Gierman</p>
