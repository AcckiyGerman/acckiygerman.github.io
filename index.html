			<p>Good Day.</p>
			<p>Already at school I programmed small games in BASIC and I liked the feeling of creating
				programs so much that in 2016 I decided to seriously study programming. My strong
				skills and work experience as an IT System Administrator proved to be a strong basis for
				this. I chose Python as my main direction and then turned to web-programming. At the
				moment the process and resources I use for my studies are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>PYTHON</b>: Mark Luchs 'Learning Python', 'Programming Python',
                    <a href='http://www.checkio.org/'>www.checkio.org</a> (solving code tasks online)
				<li><b>HTML</b>: online course on <a href='http://www.htmlacademy.ru/'>www.htmlacademy.ru</a>
				<li><b>CSS</b>: online courses <a href='http://www.htmlacademy.ru/'>www.htmlacademy.ru</a> and
                    <a href='http://www.htmlbook.ru/'>www.htmlbook.ru</a>
				<li><b>JAVASCRIPT</b>: Marijn Haverbeke 'Eloquent JavaScript'.
                <li><b>jQuery</b>: Anton Shevchuk 'jQuery for beginners'
				<li><b>GIT & GitHub</b>: Scott Chacon, Ben Straub 'Pro Git'
				<li><b>RegExp</b> (suddenly, the best tutorial is in the wikipedia)
                <li><b>MySQL</b>: materials on <a href='http://www.sql.ru/'>www.sql.ru</a>,
                    practical tasks on <a href="http://www.sql-ex.ru/">www.sql-ex.ru</a>
                <li><b>DJANGO</b>: official Django docs <a href="http://djbook.ru/rel1.9/">www.djbook.ru</a>
				<li><b>BASH</b>: Mendel Cooper "Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide"
			</ul>
            <p>You can find my code examples on
                <a href="https://github.com/acckiygerman">www.github.com/acckiygerman</a></p>
			<p>Also I have experience in LINUX server administration (Apache, MAIL, DNS, FTP-services,
				web-sites deploying, shell scripting), which can be useful for problem solving when
			undertaking web-programming.</p>
			<p>My next step will be to get practical experience in a software company and to get
				involved with the DJANGO framework.
				Also, I am interested in programming small browser games with JavaScript.</p>
			<p>I would like to work with a company which will offer support for beginners because there is still
				a lot for me to learn and I would like to gain some experience in a real work situation.</p>
			<p>I can bring immediate benefits to your organisation: I am an enthusiastic, responsible
				and fast-learning person and could be a valuable member of your great team.
				I have experience in working with demanding clients, understand the value of proper
				documentation of my work, can teach other people things I know well and also have
				experience in organizing work and managing people in small projects. I am prepared
				to start at a lower level in a career as Software Engineer and am sure we can
				successfully work together.</p>
			<p>Yours faithfully, Dmytro Gierman</p>
